Hi!

Welcome to the first P4 Language Features Library! 

In order to make an easiear approach to traffic classification and data monitoring, we are providing an Open-Source library with features that can be used in P4 programs. This is my legacy for this incredible community of SDN developers.

Each action has a paramater i, which represent an index of a register that will save the features. We suggest the user to save each feature in the SAME register index for the SAME flow. 

For example, flow number 1 will have its features in the registers of index 1, the same goes for flow number 3 and so on.

This library will continue to be updated, including new features for the use of everyone.

This is my small contribution for the field. Hope you enjoy it!
